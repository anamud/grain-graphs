# Grain Graphs

Grain graphs is a performance visualization method for OpenMP programs.

[[https://github.com/anamud/grain-graphs/wiki/figures/bots-sort-analysis.gif|alt=Grain graphs visualize grains – computation performed by a task or a parallel for-loop chunk instance – and highlights problems such as low parallelism, work inflation and poor parallelization benefit at the grain level]]

See the [wiki](https://github.com/anamud/grain-graphs/wiki) for detailed documentation about structure and utility of grain graphs, including usage of prototype implementations.
